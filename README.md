# MoBlocksMoProblems

This is a mod for Minecraft 1.8 which runs off the Forge modloader. The additional required Forge files were not included in this repository.

## The Mod

The mod adds features to Minecraft, including a naturally generating ore, Super Solid Ore, that when smelted, creates Super Solid Ingot. Super Solid Ingot then gets crafted into a Super Solid Block, which is used in the recipe for a Mystery Box. When the Mystery Box is placed and then mined, it drops a Super Hammer. The Super Hammer is an all purpose tool which acts as a diamond pickaxe, axe, and shovel all in one. Additionally, it has more attack damage than a diamond sword, and 4 times the durability of a diamond pick.
